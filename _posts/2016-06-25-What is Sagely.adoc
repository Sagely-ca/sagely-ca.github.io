:page-excerpt: An introduction to this blog.

Sagely is the way I try to approach challenges in life.  That's not to say that
I consider myself particularly wise, but that I aspire to approach things the way
I imagine someone who is wise would do.

What you'll find here is a collection of posts about Coding, Gaming, and perhaps
some general Philosophy.

This is a place for me to put my general musing, some of which may be useful to
others, I hope. Occasionally, there may also be contributions from guest authors.

I can be contacted via Twitter, as well as on Discord.app, where I am often
found in the https://discord.gg/0yT9UMxwlebCcR5t[Pwn9] server as Sage905.
