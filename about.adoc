Sagely is the way I try to approach challenges in life.  That's not to say that
I consider myself particularly wise, but that I aspire to approach things the way
I imagine someone who is wise would do.

What you'll find here is a collection of posts about Coding, Gaming, and perhaps
some general Philosophy.

This is a place for me to put my general musing, some of which may be useful to
others, I hope. Occasionally, there may also be contributions from guest authors.

You may find something of interest here, you may find something that inspires you
to be righteously indignant.  That's cool.  I'm happy to be your scapegoat.  I
used to do it professionally.

I can be contacted via Twitter, as well as on Discord.app, where I am often
found in the https://discord.gg/0yT9UMxwlebCcR5t[Pwn9] server as Sage905.
